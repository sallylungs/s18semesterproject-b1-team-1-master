# s18semesterproject-b1-team-1-master
Semester long project for CSE116 (Intro to CS II) at University at Buffalo. Codenames boardgame implemented on Java. 
Contributors were Eoghan McCaroll, Winnie Zheng, and myself. The original file for this is part of Github classroom and cannot be unprivated; thus, I reuploaded this project as a public part of my own Github.
